# Used Car Prediction model

## Program
This notebook contains implementations of a model that predicts used car prices

## Dataset
The dataset (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model fine-tuned on the Used Car Price Prediction Dataset dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance, but that is not required.

Files

* train.csv - the training dataset; refer to the original dataset link above for column descriptions
* test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the value of the target Price
* sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
